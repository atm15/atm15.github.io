title: 'Supporting Over-the-Counter Flu Testing'
summary: |
    In collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we are investigating how smartphones can help people conduct rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) on their own to diagnose the flu. We are tackling this project from multiple angles, which include procedural checks and strip interpretation through computer vision. We are also exploring ways that smartphone sensors can be used to detect symptoms, thus generating additional information for the diagnostic process.
