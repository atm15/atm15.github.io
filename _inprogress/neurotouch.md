title: 'NeuroTouch: Improving Touch Accuracy for People with Motor Impairments '
summary: |
    Touch-sensitive surfaces assume that users are able to precisely land and lift a single finger; these requirements are sometimes unreasonable for people with motor impairments. Coming from the perspective of ability-based design, we seek to upend these assumptions and make touchscreens more amenable to a wider range of touch abilities. We are exploring the use of deep learning to generate a user-specific mapping from touch patterns to touch coordinates.
