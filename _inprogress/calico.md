title: 'Chemical Sensing for Monitoring Environmental Hazards'
summary: |
    Chemical sensors are being designed to exhibit colorimetric changes in response to environmental hazards (e.g., ultraviolet radiation and carbon monoxide); however, these sensors have yet to see widespread adoption. We believe that designing such sensors for both human- and machine-interpretability will support continuous engagement. My contribution to this project includes the development of an app that supports citizen scientists and formal guidelines for chemical sensor designs.
