My dissertation work focused on the application of machine learning and computer vision on smartphone sensor data to create mobile apps that improve access to health screening and safety tools. My current research explores how such tools can be translated into practice, including a scalable method of evaluating design decisions that may affect their reception and the incorporation of continuous passive sensing to improve classification performance.
