My dissertation work focused on the application of machine learning and computer vision on smartphone sensor data to create mobile apps that improve access to health screening and safety tools. My current research explores how such tools can be made useful for ordinary people. This includes adding real-time guidance to testing procedures, leveraging passive sensing to improve the test results, and helping developers ensure their tests will be well-received.
